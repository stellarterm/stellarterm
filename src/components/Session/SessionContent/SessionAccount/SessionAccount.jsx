                    In the Stellar network, funds exist on the network and can only be moved by whoever has the secret
                    key. This means that your secret key is extremely sensitive, and whoever has access to it can move
                    the funds. However, money is <strong>NOT</strong> actually <em>{'"inside"'}</em> StellarTerm.
                    StellarTerm is just a helpful tool that helps you use your secret key to make transactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>WARNING</strong>: Be extremely careful with your secret key and do not share it with
                    anybody.
