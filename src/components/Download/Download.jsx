        <p>
            StellarTerm is a web app that runs in the browser. Downloading is <strong>not required</strong> to use
            StellarTerm. In both the web and desktop version, keys are <strong>never</strong> sent to any server and
            transactions are only signed locally. Downloads are for users that prefer a desktop version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike the web version, downloaded versions do not auto-update (this is preferrable to some people). Also,
            the web version will receive updates sooner than the desktop versions do. The code to run StellarTerm is
            self contained in the downloads, though it does not run a Stellar node or run a Stellar API.
